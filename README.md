### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer primarily using Python. I use industry-leading tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Redis to create scalable applications. 

I'm the owner and Lead Developer of [Bloxlink](https://blox.link) - the most popular Roblox Discord Bot (500k+ servers) that oversees 33M+ users.

I'm also the owner & Co-Founder of [ReAdmin](https://readmin.app) - the most innovative way to manage your Roblox staff and groups.

I'm currently a senior working towards a bachelors degree in Computer Science.
