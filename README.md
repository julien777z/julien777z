### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer primarily using Python. I use industry-leading tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Redis to create scalable applications. 

I'm also the owner and Lead Developer of [Bloxlink](https://blox.link) - the most popular Roblox Discord Bot (400k+ servers) that oversees 28M+ users.

I'm currently a senior working towards a bachelors degree in Computer Science.
